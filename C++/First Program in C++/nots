##### C++ Operators ######

 In this tutorial, we will learn about the different types of operators in C++ with the help of examples. In programming, an operator is a symbol that opertes on a value or a variable.

 Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and valus. For example (+) is an opertors used for addition, while (-) is an operator used for subtraction.

 Operators is C++ can be classified into 6 types:

 1. C++ Arithmetic Operators

 Arithmetic opertors are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. For example,
 a + b
 Here the (+) operator is used to add tow variables (a) and (b). Similarly there are various other arithnetic operators in C++.

 Operator:

 (+) Addition.
 (-) Subtraction.
 (*) Multiplication.
 (/) Division.
 (%) Modulo Operation (Remainder after division).

 2. C++ Assignment Operator

 In C++ assignment opertors are used to assign values to variables. For example..
 a = 5;

 Opertor: 

 (=) (a = n) (a = b)
 (+=) (a += b) (a = a+b)
 (-=) (a -= b) (a = a-b)
 (*=) (a *= b) (a = a*b)
 (/=) (a /= b) (a = a/b)
 (%=) (a %= b) (a = a%b)
